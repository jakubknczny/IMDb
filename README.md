# IMDb

A project for Processing of Big Data classes (hdfs) - find 3 movie genres from [IMDb movies](https://www.imdb.com/) with the highest number of the movie stars cast.

The project utilizes slightly modified MapReduce "Hello world" - world count - to count movie stars for each movie and then merges that result of MapReduce with the information about the movie stars (Hive sql).
